# 🔧 Mechanic Recommendation System
A location-based recommendation system that helps users find nearby mechanics using K-Means clustering and geospatial data processing. The system utilizes the Yelp dataset from Kaggle to provide relevant mechanic recommendations based on location and clustering.

🚀 Features
✔️ Mechanic Search & Recommendation based on location.
✔️ K-Means Clustering for efficient grouping of mechanics.
✔️ Interactive Maps with Folium & Plotly Express.
✔️ Efficient Spatial Indexing using RTree for fast queries.
✔️ Geographical Data Processing with GDAL & GeoPandas.
